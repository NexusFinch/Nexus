- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: React Context API and hooks
- **Client-side Validation**: Form validation using Formik and Yup
- **Internationalization**: Support for English and Arabic languages

### 2. Backend Layer
- **API Framework**: Next.js API routes
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Business Logic**: Modular service-based architecture
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling system

### 3. Database Layer
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-compatible database)
- **ORM**: Prisma for database interactions
- **Migrations**: Automated database migrations
- **Backup**: Regular automated backups

### 4. Integration Layer
