# Dubai SME Accounting System - Administrator Guide

## Introduction

This Administrator Guide provides detailed information for system administrators to set up, configure, and maintain the Dubai SME Accounting System. As an administrator, you have access to advanced features and settings that regular users do not.

## System Architecture

The Dubai SME Accounting System is built using modern web technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **Backend**: API routes with Cloudflare Workers
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-compatible)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system

## Installation and Deployment

### System Requirements

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- NPM 8.x or higher
- Cloudflare account for deployment

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables (see Environment Configuration section)
4. Initialize the database:
   ```
   wrangler d1 execute DB --local --file=migrations/0001_initial.sql
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. Build the application:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy to Cloudflare:
   ```
   wrangler deploy
   ```

## Environment Configuration

The system uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRY=24h

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url
```

## Database Management

### Database Structure

The system uses a relational database with the following main tables:

- `users`: User accounts and authentication
- `companies`: Company information
- `accounts`: Chart of accounts
- `products`: Product catalog
- `inventory`: Inventory tracking
- `invoices`: Invoice headers
- `invoice_items`: Invoice line items
- `journal_entries`: Accounting journal entries
- `journal_lines`: Journal entry details

### Database Maintenance

- **Backups**: Schedule regular database backups
- **Migrations**: Apply database migrations when updating the system
- **Optimization**: Periodically optimize database performance
